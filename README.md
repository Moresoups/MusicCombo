# MusicCombo

## Description

Our objective is to create a simple application that uses two different elements to create a combination that reveals a music artist. The guidelines of the project dictate that we follow certain criteria, such as the implementation of a new CSS framework (Bulma) and the use of two or more APIs. 

The page displays six "Element" buttons that a user is asked to select and click two of said buttons to create music. Beneath the six buttons is a much larger button that reads "Combine!" Once a user has selected their two choices, they hit combine to execute the operation to find and create both a YouTube video, and Spotify information on a band that they may or may not have heard of before. 

The user will also be able to see which combinations they have already attempted in the "Combinations Discovered" box at the bottom of the screen. The interface is simple and clean, allowing a user to easily navigate the functionality of the application.
